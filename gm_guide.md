# "Spend It All" - Game Master Guide

## Pre-Game Setup (5 minutes)

### Opening Narration
*"You've just left the reading of eccentric billionaire Uncle Mortimer's will. The lawyer's words echo in your mind: 'The entire 10 billion dollar fortune goes to [Heir's name]... IF the group can spend every penny within 30 days. But there are rules: no charitable donations, no lasting investments, no telling anyone why you're spending. You must prove you understand that money is meant to be enjoyed, not hoarded. The clock starts... now.'"*

### Character Assignment
- Have players choose or randomly assign character roles
- Ask each player to briefly describe their character's relationship to the Heir
- Establish why this group is helping with the challenge

### Ground Rules
- Emphasize collaborative storytelling over competition
- Explain that failure can create interesting stories too
- Set the tone: absurd comedy, not realistic economics

## Time Management
- **Act 1**: 5 minutes (setup and planning)
- **Act 2**: 18-20 minutes (3 weeks Ã— 6 minutes each)
- **Act 3**: 5 minutes (resolution and epilogue)
- **Buffer**: 2-3 minutes for overflow

## Difficulty Guidelines

### Setting Target Numbers
Don't just use the tier suggestions mechanically. Consider:
- **Narrative Impact**: Cooler ideas should be easier
- **Collaboration Level**: More players involved = easier
- **Story Moment**: Dramatic moments deserve better odds
- **Previous Failures**: After setbacks, be more generous

### Adjusting on the Fly
- If players are struggling: Lower difficulties or offer bonus dice
- If too easy: Add complications rather than higher numbers
- If stuck: Provide inspiration through NPCs or events

## Complication Generator

### Week 1 Complications (Light)
Roll d6 when players fail or for dramatic timing:

1. **Paperwork Delays**: "The contract requires approval from 12 different departments"
2. **Vendor Confusion**: "They think you're joking and won't take your money seriously"
3. **Scheduling Conflicts**: "Everyone you want to hire is already booked"
4. **Technical Problems**: "The payment system crashes when processing large amounts"
5. **Insurance Issues**: "No one will insure this ridiculous venture"
6. **Language Barriers**: "The international vendor speaks only ancient Latin"

### Week 2 Complications (Medium)
1. **Media Attention**: "Reporters are asking why you're spending so extravagantly"
2. **Family Concerns**: "Distant relatives are questioning your mental state"
3. **Legal Scrutiny**: "Government agencies want to investigate money laundering"
4. **Vendor Greed**: "Word has spread - everyone is inflating their prices"
5. **Logistical Nightmares**: "Your purchases are creating traffic/space/timing conflicts"
6. **Ethical Dilemmas**: "Your spending is affecting local communities/markets"

### Week 3 Complications (Heavy)
1. **Lawyer Interference**: "Uncle Mortimer's lawyers are trying to stop 'irresponsible' spending"
2. **International Incidents**: "Your purchases are causing diplomatic problems"
3. **Economic Impact**: "You're accidentally affecting stock markets/currency values"
4. **Time Crunch**: "Multiple purchases must happen simultaneously"
5. **Betrayal**: "A trusted vendor is secretly working for rival family members"

## Ending Scenarios

### Complete Success (9-10B spent)
*"As the clock strikes midnight on day 30, Uncle Mortimer's portrait seems to wink. The inheritance is yours, along with memories that will last a lifetime. But more importantly, you've learned that the real treasure was the absolutely ridiculous experiences you shared together."*

### Partial Success (7-8.9B spent)
*"Uncle Mortimer's backup clause activates: you get the inheritance, but must continue to spend extravagantly for one month each year. The family tradition of absurd wealth continues, whether you like it or not."*

### Near Miss (5-6.9B spent)
*"The lawyers offer one final chance: spend the remaining amount in 24 hours, with even stricter restrictions. Do you dare attempt one last, desperate spending spree?"*

### Failure (<5B spent)
*"You don't get the money, but you realize you've gained something more valuable: friendships forged through shared absurdity, and stories that will be told for generations. Plus, you still have several billion dollars in leftover money to live comfortably."*
