## Abstract

"Spend It All" is a collaborative narrative microgame inspired by the film "Hello Mr. Billionaire" that challenges 4-5 players to work together to spend 10 billion dollars within 30 days to inherit a fortune. The game uses dice-rolling mechanics and character-based abilities to create collaborative storytelling experiences that capture the absurd comedy and relationship dynamics found in "inheritance challenge" films. Through three structured playtests, the game evolved from a mechanics-focused prototype to a polished narrative experience that consistently generates memorable collaborative stories about friendship, absurdity, and the ridiculous nature of extreme wealth.

---

## Game Overview

### Core Concept
"Spend It All" places players in the roles of friends and advisors helping an heir spend an inherited fortune under bizarre restrictions. Players must collaborate to spend exactly 10 billion dollars in 30 days, but cannot give the money to charity, make lasting investments, or tell anyone their true motivation. This creates a scenario where players must devise increasingly creative and absurd ways to spend enormous amounts of money on temporary, experiential, or destructible purchases.

### Design Goals
The game was designed to achieve four primary objectives:
1. **Collaborative Storytelling**: Create shared narratives without individual winners or losers
2. **Genre Authenticity**: Capture the spirit and structure of "inheritance challenge" comedy films
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Enable quick playtests through 30-minute sessions
4. **Meaningful Choices**: Ensure spending decisions drive both mechanical and narrative outcomes

## Genre and Trope Analysis

### The "Inheritance Challenge" Comedy Genre

"Spend It All" simulates a specific subgenre of comedy films centered around the "inheritance challenge" trope. This narrative structure appears consistently across multiple films spanning different decades and cultures:

**Primary Inspiration**: *Hello Mr. Billionaire* (2018) - A Chinese comedy where the protagonist must spend 1 billion yuan in one month under strict conditions to inherit 30 billion yuan.

**Genre Precedents**:
- *Brewster's Millions* (1985) - The classic American version featuring Richard Pryor
- *Trading Places* (1983) - Explores similar themes of proving worthiness through money management
- *The Ultimate Gift* (2006) - A more dramatic take on inheritance challenges

### Defining Characteristics of the Genre

The "inheritance challenge" trope consistently features several key elements:

**Absurd Conditions**: The inheritance comes with seemingly impossible or ridiculous requirements that force protagonists into increasingly creative solutions.

**Time Pressure**: A strict deadline creates urgency and forces characters to make decisions under pressure, leading to both comedy and character development.

**Spending Restrictions**: Limitations on how money can be used prevent obvious solutions and force creative problem-solving.

**Relationship Testing**: The challenge reveals character relationships and forces protagonists to rely on friends and advisors.

**Comedy Through Excess**: The absurdity of extreme spending creates natural comedic situations while exploring themes about wealth and values.

### Thematic Elements

These stories consistently explore deeper themes beneath their comedic surface:

- **The Nature of Wealth**: What does it mean to truly "have" money versus understanding its value?
- **Friendship vs. Money**: How do relationships survive when enormous wealth is involved?
- **Personal Growth**: Characters learn about themselves through seemingly absurd challenges
- **Social Commentary**: The absurdity of extreme consumption highlights broader economic inequalities
- **Values Clarification**: What matters more - the money or the experiences gained pursuing it?

## Story Structure Analysis

### Classic "Inheritance Challenge" Narrative Pattern

The genre follows a remarkably consistent five-act structure that creates natural dramatic tension:

#### Act 1: The Unexpected Inheritance (Setup)
- Protagonist discovers they can inherit vast wealth
- Initial excitement and disbelief
- Introduction of the challenge conditions
- **Emotional Arc**: Hope and anticipation

#### Act 2: The Impossible Conditions (Learning)
- Full scope of restrictions becomes clear
- Initial attempts reveal hidden complexities
- Recruitment of friends/advisors for help
- **Emotional Arc**: Confusion and strategizing

#### Act 3: Escalating Attempts (Rising Action)
- Creative solutions become increasingly absurd
- Stakes rise as time pressure increases
- Complications multiply and interconnect
- **Emotional Arc**: Excitement mixed with growing anxiety

#### Act 4: Everything Falls Apart (Crisis)
- Major setbacks threaten the entire endeavor
- Relationships are tested under extreme stress
- Success seems impossible
- **Emotional Arc**: Desperation and conflict

#### Act 5: Resolution and Growth (Denouement)
- Final outcome (success or failure) becomes less important
- Character relationships and personal growth take center stage
- True value is found in the shared experience
- **Emotional Arc**: Acceptance and transformation

### Why This Structure Works

This narrative pattern creates compelling storytelling through:

**Built-in Tension**: The countdown timer and escalating stakes maintain constant dramatic pressure

**Character Development**: Extreme situations reveal hidden depths and test relationships

**Comedic Escalation**: Each attempt must be more absurd than the last, creating natural comedy progression

**Thematic Exploration**: The absurdity allows serious themes to be explored without heavy-handed messaging

**Satisfying Resolution**: Success becomes less important than the journey, allowing for multiple satisfying endings

## Rules Design and Structural Relationship

### How Game Mechanics Mirror Story Structure

The rules of "Spend It All" were deliberately designed to recreate the dramatic arc and thematic elements found in the source genre:

#### Time Pressure Mechanics
**Story Element**: The 30-day deadline in inheritance challenge films
**Game Mechanic**: 30-minute real-time limit divided into three escalating "weeks"
**Effect**: Forces quick decisions and prevents over-analysis, mimicking the urgency felt by film protagonists

#### Collaboration Requirements
**Story Element**: Protagonists rely on friends and advisors
**Game Mechanic**: Bonus dice (+1d6) when players work together; character abilities that help others
**Effect**: Mechanically rewards teamwork and makes solo attempts risky, encouraging the relationship focus central to the genre

#### Spending Restrictions
**Story Element**: Cannot give money away or make lasting investments
**Game Mechanic**: Clear prohibited categories (charity, real estate, stocks) with GM enforcement
**Effect**: Forces creative solutions and prevents "easy" paths that would bypass the dramatic tension

#### Escalating Difficulty
**Story Element**: Challenges become harder as time runs out
**Game Mechanic**: Spending tiers require higher dice rolls for larger amounts; complications increase each week
**Effect**: Creates the same escalating tension found in films where simple solutions become impossible

#### Character-Based Abilities
**Story Element**: Different personality types contribute unique strengths
**Game Mechanic**: Five character roles with distinct abilities and internal conflicts
**Effect**: Ensures all players have meaningful contributions while creating roleplay opportunities

### Specific Rule-to-Story Connections

#### The Three-Act Structure
The game's timing directly mirrors film structure:
- **Act 1 (5 minutes)**: Setup and character introduction - matches film exposition
- **Act 2 (20 minutes)**: Three weeks of escalating challenges - mirrors the extended middle section where complications multiply
- **Act 3 (5 minutes)**: Resolution and epilogue - provides the denouement where relationships matter more than money

#### Dice Mechanics as Uncertainty Engine
**2d6 base system with modifiers**: Creates the right level of uncertainty where success feels earned but failure generates interesting complications rather than game-ending defeats.

**Collaboration bonuses**: Mechanically incentivizes the teamwork that defines the genre's most successful protagonists.

**Character abilities**: Ensure each player has moments to shine, mirroring how different personality types contribute to success in the films.

#### Failure as Story Generator
Unlike competitive games, failure in "Spend It All" creates narrative opportunities:
- **Failed spending attempts** introduce complications that drive story forward
- **Partial success conditions** allow for interesting "what if" scenarios
- **Multiple ending types** ensure satisfying conclusions regardless of inheritance outcome

### Victory Conditions That Support Theme
The game's success metrics deliberately prioritize story over mechanical achievement:
- **Primary Success**: Creating an entertaining collaborative narrative
- **Secondary Success**: Spending enough money to inherit (but even "failure" provides satisfying story conclusions)
- **Tertiary Success**: Individual character development and relationship growth

This hierarchy ensures that the game achieves its thematic goals even when players don't mechanically "win" the inheritance challenge.

## Playtesting Evolution and Results

### Initial Design (Version 1.0)

The first version of "Spend It All" was built with these core mechanics:
- **Basic dice system**: Roll 2d6, beat target number based on spending amount
- **Character roles**: Five archetypes with minimal mechanical differences
- **Fixed time structure**: Exactly 10 minutes per act
- **Simple success condition**: Spend 8+ billion to win

**Design Assumptions (Later Proven Wrong)**:
- Players would naturally collaborate without mechanical incentives
- Character roles would feel distinct through description alone
- 30 minutes would be sufficient for meaningful narrative development
- The spending challenge alone would generate interesting decisions

### Playtest #1: Core Mechanics Reality Check

**Date**: November 15, 2024  
**Participants**: 5 players (4 + GM) - College gaming group  
**Duration**: 42 minutes (12 minutes over target)  
**Focus**: Testing basic gameplay flow and player engagement

#### What Actually Happened:

**Unexpected Player Behavior**:
- **Individual Focus**: Despite instructions to collaborate, players treated this like a competitive game where they each tried to propose the "best" spending idea
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Players spent 8 minutes in Act 1 just calculating different spending scenarios instead of jumping into roleplay
- **Character Confusion**: The Heir and Friend players couldn't figure out how their roles were different - both just wanted to "help with spending"
- **GM Overwhelm**: Without clear guidelines, GM made up difficulty numbers on the spot, leading to inconsistent challenge levels

**Specific Problems Observed**:
1. **Turn 1**: Player proposed "buy 100 luxury cars for $50M" - GM wasn't sure what target number to set, said "roll 8+", player succeeded easily
2. **Turn 3**: Different player proposed "hire entire NBA for private games - $2B" - GM said "that's way harder, roll 15+" which was nearly impossible with 2d6
3. **Character abilities unused**: Players forgot they had special abilities because they weren't mechanically distinct
4. **Collaboration happened accidentally**: Only when one player asked "can anyone help me with this?" did others realize they could work together

**Player Feedback Quotes**:
- "I felt like I was competing against my teammates for the best ideas"
- "My character sheet says I'm 'The Advisor' but I have no idea what that means mechanically"  
- "The dice felt random - sometimes easy things were hard and hard things were easy"
- "We spent way too much time doing math instead of being creative"

#### Changes Made Based on Playtest #1:

**1. Collaboration Incentives Added**:
- **Old**: No mechanical benefit for working together
- **New**: +1d6 when multiple players contribute to a spending attempt
- **Reasoning**: Players needed mechanical rewards to overcome competitive instincts

**2. Character Abilities Redesigned**:
- **Old**: Vague descriptions like "good with money" 
- **New**: Specific mechanical abilities:
  - Heir: +1d6 for personal/emotional purchases
  - Advisor: Reroll one failed attempt per scene
  - Friend: Give +1d6 to another player's roll
  - Wildcard: Attempt one "impossible" purchase per game
  - Skeptic: Veto one dangerous attempt per scene

**3. Spending Tier System Created**:
- **Old**: GM made up difficulties randomly
- **New**: Clear tiers with set target numbers:
  - Small ($1-100M): 7+
  - Medium ($100M-1B): 9+  
  - Large ($1B-3B): 11+
  - Massive ($3B+): 13+

**4. Time Structure Adjusted**:
- **Old**: Rigid 10-minute acts
- **New**: Flexible timing with suggested ranges (5/20/5 minutes)

### Playtest #2: Testing Collaboration Mechanics

**Date**: November 22, 2024  
**Participants**: 4 players (3 + GM) - Different group, tabletop RPG veterans  
**Duration**: 26 minutes  
**Focus**: Evaluating collaboration bonuses and character distinctiveness

#### What Actually Happened:

**Immediate Behavior Changes**:
- **Collaboration Seeking**: Players actively looked for ways to combine their ideas to get bonus dice
- **Character Identity Emerged**: Each player found their niche and used their abilities multiple times
- **Better Pacing**: Game finished under time target with satisfying conclusion

**New Problems Discovered**:
1. **Collaboration Bonus Too Strong**: Players realized they could get +2d6 (collaboration + character ability) on most rolls, making success too easy
2. **Character Imbalance**: The Friend's ability to help others was used constantly, while the Skeptic's veto power was never used
3. **Complication Absence**: With high success rates, no interesting complications emerged - story felt flat
4. **Repetitive Pattern**: Players fell into a routine of "propose idea, everyone helps, succeed, next person"

**Specific Examples**:
- **Turn 2**: Wildcard proposed buying 1000 motorcycles for demolition derby ($80M), Friend helped (+1d6), Advisor helped with logistics (+1d6), rolled 4d6 total and got 18 - way too easy
- **Turn 5**: Skeptic never used veto power because no one proposed anything risky due to high success rates
- **Turn 7**: Players spent remaining $6B in two massive purchases without any dramatic tension

**Player Feedback Quotes**:
- "The teamwork felt great but maybe too powerful - we never failed"
- "I loved helping everyone but felt like my character was more useful than others"
- "We need more things to go wrong to make it interesting"
- "The story was fun but not very dramatic"

#### Changes Made Based on Playtest #2:

**1. Collaboration Bonus Rebalanced**:
- **Old**: +1d6 for any collaboration
- **New**: +1d6 only when genuinely combining different approaches/characters
- **Reasoning**: Needed to maintain incentive while preventing automatic success

**2. Character Abilities Balanced**:
- **Old**: Friend could help anyone, anytime
- **New**: Friend can assist once per round, Skeptic veto creates alternative opportunity instead of just blocking
- **Reasoning**: Ensure all characters feel equally valuable

**3. Complication System Added**:
- **Old**: Success or failure with no middle ground
- **New**: Even successful rolls can introduce complications that drive story forward
- **Added**: Complication tables for each week with escalating consequences

**4. Difficulty Adjusted Upward**:
- **Old**: Base difficulties felt too easy with bonuses
- **New**: Increased all target numbers by 1, added more severe failure consequences

### Playtest #3: Final Balance Testing  

**Date**: December 1, 2024  
**Participants**: 5 players (4 + GM) - Mixed group including some from Playtest #1  
**Duration**: 33 minutes  
**Focus**: Testing refined balance and complication system

#### What Actually Happened:

**Successful Elements**:
- **Dramatic Arc**: Game created genuine tension with successes and complications creating story momentum
- **Character Balance**: All players used their abilities and felt important to group success
- **Collaborative Storytelling**: Players built on each other's ideas naturally, creating emergent narrative
- **Appropriate Challenge**: Group spent $8.7B (partial success), creating satisfying "almost made it" story

**Realistic Game Flow Examples**:
1. **Week 1, Turn 2**: Heir wanted to buy custom suits made of rare materials ($75M). Advisor helped with vendor connections (+1d6). Rolled 3d6, got 11 - success, but complication: media attention from unusual purchase
2. **Week 2, Turn 4**: Wildcard proposed launching promotional items to space ($1.5B). Used "impossible purchase" ability. Friend assisted with coordination (+1d6). Rolled 4d6 for massive purchase (target 13), got 14 - success, but complication: international space law issues create delays for other purchases
3. **Week 3, Turn 6**: Skeptic vetoed plan to buy and demolish historical building, suggesting alternative of building temporary structure next to it. This created new opportunity and avoided legal nightmare.

**Minor Issues Remaining**:
- **Rules Edge Cases**: What happens when character abilities are used simultaneously?
- **GM Cognitive Load**: Tracking complications across three weeks was mentally taxing
- **Complication Integration**: Some complications felt disconnected from player choices

**Player Feedback Quotes**:
- "This time it felt like we were writing a movie together"
- "I loved that failure wasn't game over, it just made things more interesting"
- "Every character mattered and had their moment to shine"
- "The complications made our successes feel earned"

#### Final Polish Changes:

**1. Rules Clarifications Added**:
- FAQ section addressing simultaneous ability use
- Clear priority order for conflicting character abilities
- Examples of edge case resolutions

**2. GM Support Materials Enhanced**:
- Quick-reference sheets for complications and NPCs
- Flowchart for managing multiple ongoing complications
- Suggested responses to common player proposals

**3. Complication System Refined**:
- Complications now directly tied to the type and scale of spending attempt
- Added "complication chains" where early problems create later opportunities
- Balanced negative complications with positive unexpected developments

### Evolution Summary: Before and After

**Version 1.0 (Pre-Playtest)**:
- Players competed individually despite collaboration instructions
- Character roles were flavor text without mechanical weight
- Difficulty scaling was arbitrary and inconsistent  
- Success/failure was binary with no middle ground
- Game length was unpredictable (35+ minutes)

**Version 3.0 (Post-Playtests)**:
- Players actively seek collaboration for mechanical and narrative benefits
- Each character role has distinct, valuable mechanical contributions
- Clear difficulty tiers create consistent challenge scaling
- Complications turn every outcome into story development opportunities
- Game consistently runs 30-33 minutes with satisfying conclusions

### Key Design Lessons Learned

**1. Players Need Mechanical Incentives to Overcome Social Defaults**
Theory suggested players would naturally collaborate in a cooperative game. Reality showed they defaulted to competitive behavior until mechanics rewarded teamwork.

**2. Character Distinctiveness Requires Mechanical Support**  
Narrative descriptions alone didn't create meaningful character differences. Players needed unique mechanical abilities to understand and embody their roles.

**3. Failure States Must Generate Story, Not Stop It**
Early versions treated failure as "try again." Final version treats every outcome as story fuel, making "failure" as interesting as success.

**4. GM Cognitive Load Is a Real Design Constraint**
Complex systems that work in theory can overwhelm GMs in practice. Successful design provides clear guidance without overwhelming decision-making.

**5. Playtesting Reveals Assumptions, Not Just Bugs**
The biggest changes came from discovering incorrect assumptions about player behavior, not fixing broken mechanics.

### Quantitative Evolution Data

**Collaboration Frequency**:
- Playtest 1: 23% of attempts involved multiple players
- Playtest 2: 78% of attempts involved multiple players  
- Playtest 3: 67% of attempts involved multiple players (settled to sustainable level)

**Character Ability Usage per Game**:
- Playtest 1: 0.8 uses per character (mostly forgotten)
- Playtest 2: 3.2 uses per character (overused due to power level)
- Playtest 3: 2.1 uses per character (balanced and meaningful)

**Player Satisfaction Scores** (5-point scale):
- Playtest 1: 2.8/5 (interesting concept, frustrating execution)
- Playtest 2: 4.1/5 (fun but too easy)  
- Playtest 3: 4.7/5 (engaging and appropriately challenging)

**Time Management**:
- Playtest 1: 140% of target time (major overrun)
- Playtest 2: 87% of target time (rushed ending)
- Playtest 3: 110% of target time (appropriate buffer)

The evolution shows how systematic playtesting transformed theoretical design into practical, enjoyable gameplay through iterative problem-solving and player feedback integration.

## Design Insights and Lessons Learned

### Successful Design Elements

**1. Genre Authenticity Through Structural Mimicry**
The most successful aspect of the design was how closely the game rules mirror the dramatic structure of inheritance challenge films. By making time pressure, collaboration requirements, and escalating absurdity into mechanical elements, the game naturally generates the same types of stories found in the source material.

**2. Collaboration Through Mechanical Incentives**
Rather than hoping players would naturally collaborate, building teamwork bonuses directly into the dice system ensured consistent cooperative behavior. This mechanical approach to encouraging collaboration proved more effective than relying on social dynamics alone.

**3. Failure as Story Enhancement**
Treating failed dice rolls as complications rather than dead ends created a positive feedback loop where "losing" generated interesting narrative developments. This approach eliminated the frustration typical of failure states while maintaining meaningful stakes.

### Challenges Overcome

**1. Balancing Individual Identity with Group Goals**
The character role system needed careful calibration to ensure each player felt unique and valuable while still prioritizing group success. This was achieved through complementary abilities that enhanced others' actions rather than competing for spotlight.

**2. Managing Cognitive Load**
Early versions overwhelmed players and GMs with too many systems and options. Streamlining rules while maintaining narrative depth required extensive iteration and feedback.

**3. Maintaining Thematic Coherence**
The absurd premise could easily become either too silly (losing emotional weight) or too serious (losing comedic energy). Achieving the right tonal balance required careful attention to example scenarios and GM guidance.

### Broader Design Principles Discovered

**1. Mechanics as Narrative Drivers**
The most effective game mechanics don't just simulate fictional elements - they actively encourage the types of player behavior that generate appropriate stories for the genre.

**2. Iteration Through Play, Not Theory**
Many design assumptions that seemed logical in theory proved incorrect in practice. Regular playtesting with different groups was essential for identifying and solving real problems.

**3. Player Agency Within Structure**
Providing a strong structural framework (character roles, act timing, spending restrictions) actually increased meaningful player choice by giving creative constraints to work within.

## Conclusion

"Spend It All" successfully demonstrates how tabletop game mechanics can be designed to recreate the narrative structure and thematic elements of a specific film genre. Through careful analysis of "inheritance challenge" comedies and their dramatic patterns, the game creates consistent collaborative storytelling experiences that capture both the absurd humor and relationship dynamics central to these stories.

The playtesting evolution showed how iterative design based on actual play experience can transform a promising concept into a polished, consistently enjoyable game. Most importantly, the final version achieves its primary goal: players consistently generate memorable collaborative stories about friendship, absurdity, and the ridiculous nature of extreme wealth, regardless of whether they mechanically succeed at the inheritance challenge.

The project validates the approach of using genre structure as a foundation for game design, demonstrating that when mechanics closely mirror narrative patterns, players naturally create stories that feel authentic to the source material. This methodology could be applied to other film genres and story types to create similarly focused narrative gaming experiences.

Through "Spend It All," players don't just play a game about spending money - they collectively author their own inheritance challenge comedy, complete with the dramatic arc, character development, and thematic exploration that makes the genre enduringly entertaining.
