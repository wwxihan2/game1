# "Spend It All" - Narrative Microgame

**A collaborative storytelling game inspired by "Hello Mr. Billionaire"**

*4-5 players + 1 GM | 30 minutes | Ages 14+*

## Quick Start

1. **Print**: `player_rules.md` and `character_sheets.md` for all players
2. **Print**: `gm_guide.md` for the Game Master  
3. **Gather**: 3-4 six-sided dice
4. **Play**: Follow the three-act structure for about 30 minutes of ridiculous fun!

## Game Overview

In "Spend It All," players work together as a team to spend 10 billion dollars in 30 days to inherit a fortune. But there's a catch - they can't simply give it away or invest it. They must spend it on temporary, experiential, or destructible things while keeping their mission secret.

The game emphasizes **collaborative storytelling** over competition. Players succeed or fail together, creating absurd and memorable stories about friendship, wealth, and the ridiculous nature of extreme spending.

1. Fill out the `playtest_feedback.md` form
2. Focus on what created the best collaborative moments
3. Note any rules confusion or pacing issues
4. Share your most memorable spending attempts!

The game improves through actual play, so your feedback is crucial for development.

## Academic Context

This game was designed as a final project for a narrative game design course, specifically addressing:
- **Genre simulation**: "Inheritance challenge" comedy trope
- **Collaborative mechanics**: No individual winners, shared storytelling
- **Rapid iteration**: Quick playtests enable design refinement
- **Thematic coherence**: Rules support the absurd wealth spending theme

## Presentation Materials

For the final presentation, use:
- `presentation_outline.md` for talking points and slide structure
- `project_summary.md` for comprehensive written documentation
- Actual play examples from your playtests
- Feedback data showing iteration improvements

## Tips for Success

### For an Engaging Game:
- **Say "Yes, And"** - Build on crazy ideas rather than shutting them down
- **Focus on Story** - The inheritance is less important than the experience
- **Embrace Failure** - Failed spending attempts create great complications  
- **Collaborate Actively** - Use the bonus dice for working together
- **Stay Absurd** - Realistic financial planning defeats the purpose!

### For Good Design Iteration:
- **Test with Different Groups** - Various perspectives reveal different issues
- **Focus Each Playtest** - Don't try to fix everything at once
- **Document Everything** - Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
- **Be Willing to Change** - Rules serve the story, not the other way around

## Questions?

This game prioritizes fun collaborative storytelling over mechanical complexity. If rules questions arise during play, choose the interpretation that:
1. Keeps the story moving
2. Includes all players  
3. Maintains the comedic tone
4. Encourages teamwork

Remember: The goal is to create an entertaining story together, not to perfectly simulate economics or win a competition.

## Version Notes

This is the initial design version, intended for playtesting and iteration. Expect changes based on actual play experience!

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct three structured playtests
2. Refine mechanics based on feedback
3. Polish presentation materials
4. Document the evolution process
