## Executive Summary

"Spend It All" is a collaborative narrative microgame inspired by the movie "Hello Mr. Billionaire" that challenges 4-5 players to work together as a team to spend 10 billion dollars within 30 days (game time) to inherit a fortune. The game emphasizes cooperative storytelling over individual competition, using dice rolling mechanics to create uncertainty and collaborative decision-making to drive narrative engagement.

The game is designed for rapid iteration with a 30-minute play time, allowing for multiple playtests and refinements during the development process. Through three structured playtests, the game will evolve from initial concept to polished final product, with each iteration focusing on specific design elements.

## Genre and Trope Analysis

### Chosen Genre: "Inheritance Challenge" Comedy

The game focuses on a specific subgenre of comedy films centered around absurd wealth spending challenges. This trope appears in multiple films including:

- **Hello Mr. Billionaire** (2018) - The primary inspiration
- **Brewster's Millions** (1985) - Classic American version
- **Trading Places** (1983) - Similar themes of proving worthiness through money

### Structure of These Stories

The "inheritance challenge" narrative follows a predictable but engaging pattern:

1. **Unexpected Inheritance**: Protagonist discovers they can inherit vast wealth
2. **Impossible Conditions**: The inheritance comes with seemingly absurd requirements
3. **Learning Phase**: Initial attempts reveal hidden complexities and restrictions  
4. **Escalating Stakes**: Challenges become more difficult, time pressure increases
5. **Crisis Point**: Everything seems impossible, relationships are tested
6. **Resolution**: Success/failure becomes less important than personal growth and relationships

This structure creates natural dramatic tension through:
- **Time pressure** that forces difficult decisions
- **Escalating complexity** that requires creative problem-solving
- **Relationship testing** that reveals character depth
- **Absurd situations** that generate comedy while exploring themes

### Thematic Elements

These stories consistently explore themes of:
- The corrupting vs. liberating nature of wealth
- The value of friendship and loyalty over money
- The absurdity of extreme consumption
- Personal growth through shared challenges
- The difference between having money and understanding its true value

### Three-Act Structure

#### Act 1: Reading of the Will (5 minutes)
- GM introduces the inheritance scenario and restrictions
- Players establish characters and relationships
- Initial planning and goal setting

#### Act 2: The Spending Spree (20 minutes)
Divided into three "weeks" of escalating complexity:

**Week 1 (6 minutes)**: Learning the ropes
- Easier spending challenges to establish mechanics
- Introduction of basic complications
- Building player confidence and collaboration

**Week 2 (7 minutes)**: Rising stakes  
- Medium-difficulty challenges with more complex complications
- Relationship tensions and moral dilemmas emerge
- Introduction of time pressure and competing priorities

**Week 3 (7 minutes)**: Desperate measures
- High-stakes spending with severe time pressure
- Multiple simultaneous challenges
- Character relationships tested under extreme stress

#### Act 3: Final Judgment (5 minutes)

## How Rules Relate to Narrative Structure

### Collaboration Mechanics Support Relationship Focus

The game's mechanical emphasis on collaboration directly supports the thematic focus on friendship and teamwork:

- **Bonus dice for teamwork** makes cooperation mechanically advantageous
- **Character abilities that help others** encourages mutual support
- **Shared success/failure** prevents individual competition from undermining group story
- **Character conflicts** create roleplay opportunities that develop relationships

### Time Pressure Creates Narrative Tension

The structured time limit mirrors the countdown tension found in the source films:

- **30-day in-game deadline** forces difficult decisions under pressure
- **Three-week structure** creates escalating urgency
- **Real-time 30-minute limit** maintains energy and prevents over-analysis
- **Escalating complications** increase stakes as time runs out

### Spending Restrictions Force Creative Solutions

The limitations on spending types recreate the protagonists' dilemma from the films:

- **No easy solutions** (like charity) forces creative thinking
- **Temporary purchases only** creates absurd scenarios
- **Secrecy requirements** add complications and tension
- **Large amounts** make simple purchases inadequate

### Failure as Narrative Opportunity

Unlike competitive games, failure in "Spend It All" creates storytelling opportunities:

- **Partial success conditions** allow for interesting "what if" scenarios
- **Complications from failed rolls** introduce new plot elements
- **Character abilities to mitigate failure** let players help each other recover
- **Multiple ending types** ensure satisfying conclusions regardless of money spent

## Conclusion

"Spend It All" represents a focused approach to collaborative narrative game design that prioritizes storytelling over competition while maintaining mechanical engagement through dice rolling and character abilities. By grounding the design in a specific and well-understood genre, the game provides clear thematic guidance while allowing for creative expression within that framework.

The three-playtest iteration plan ensures that the final game will be refined through actual play experience rather than theoretical design, addressing the assignment's emphasis on learning through failure and revision. The 30-minute play time facilitates this rapid iteration while providing a complete and satisfying gaming experience.

Most importantly, the game's focus on collaborative storytelling and shared outcomes aligns with the assignment's requirement for games about cooperation rather than individual victory. Players succeed or fail together, creating stories about friendship, absurdity, and the ridiculous nature of extreme wealth that will be memorable regardless of whether they actually manage to spend all 10 billion dollars.

The game design demonstrates how mechanical systems can serve narrative goals, how genre conventions can provide structure without limiting creativity, and how rapid iteration can lead to polished final products that achieve their intended design objectives.
