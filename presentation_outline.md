# "Spend It All" - Final Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: Title
**"Spend It All"**
*A Collaborative Narrative Microgame*

Inspired by "Hello Mr. Billionaire"

## Slide 2: The Genre/Trope
**"Inheritance Challenge" Comedy**
- Subgenre of absurd wealth spending stories
- Core trope: Must prove worthiness through seemingly impossible task
- Examples: Hello Mr. Billionaire, Brewster's Millions, Trading Places
- Focus: Absurd spending creates both comedy and character growth

## Slide 3: Story Structure Analysis
**Classic "Inheritance Challenge" Pattern:**
1. **Setup**: Unexpected inheritance with bizarre conditions
2. **Learning**: Initial attempts reveal hidden complexities  
3. **Escalation**: Stakes rise, complications multiply
4. **Crisis**: Everything seems impossible, relationships tested
5. **Resolution**: Success/failure less important than personal growth

*This structure creates natural dramatic arc with built-in time pressure*

## Slide 4: Game Overview
**Players**: 4-5 + GM | **Time**: 30 minutes | **Mechanic**: Collaborative dice rolling

**The Challenge**: Spend 10 billion dollars in 30 days to inherit the fortune

**Key Restrictions**:
- No charity donations
- No lasting investments  
- No telling anyone the real reason
- Must spend on temporary/experiential things

## Slide 5: Character Roles & Conflicts
### Character Archetypes:
- **üé≠ The Heir**: Personal spending bonus, struggles with worthiness
- **üíº The Advisor**: Reroll failures, professional ethics vs. loyalty  
- **ü§ù The Friend**: Assists others, loyalty vs. moral concerns
- **üé≤ The Wildcard**: Attempts impossible purchases, creativity vs. recklessness
- **ü§î The Skeptic**: Can veto bad ideas, pragmatism vs. helping friends

*Each role has internal conflicts that drive roleplay and external abilities that enable collaboration*

## Slide 6: Core Mechanics
### Dice System:
- Base: 2d6 for spending attempts
- Collaboration: +1d6 when working together
- Character abilities: Special bonuses/rerolls
- Spending tiers: $1-100M (7+), $100M-1B (9+), $1B-3B (11+), $3B+ (13+)

### Success Through Collaboration:
- Solo attempts are harder and riskier
- Team efforts get bonus dice
- Character abilities complement each other
- Failure creates narrative opportunities, not game over

## Slide 7: Three-Act Structure
### Act 1: Reading of the Will (5 min)
- Character introduction and relationship establishment
- Rules explanation and initial planning

### Act 2: The Spending Spree (20 min)
- **Week 1**: Learning the ropes (easier challenges)
- **Week 2**: Rising stakes (complications emerge)  
- **Week 3**: Desperate measures (high pressure, big risks)

### Act 3: Final Judgment (5 min)
- Calculate results and collaborative storytelling of outcome

## Slide 8: How Rules Support Story Structure
### Time Pressure = Narrative Tension
- 30-day deadline mirrors dramatic countdown
- Three weeks create escalating urgency
- Forces difficult decisions under pressure

### Collaboration Mechanics = Relationship Focus
- Bonus dice for teamwork encourages cooperation
- Character abilities require mutual support
- Success/failure is shared, not individual

### Spending Restrictions = Creative Constraints
- Forces innovative thinking like movie protagonists
- Creates comedic situations through absurd purchases
- Prevents "easy" solutions that bypass dramatic tension

## Slide 9: Sample Gameplay
**Scenario**: Week 2, trying to spend $500M

**Wildcard**: "What if we buy 1000 luxury cars and crash them into an art installation?"

**Advisor**: "The insurance complications alone will cost millions... which actually helps us spend more!"

**Friend**: "I'll help coordinate with the artists!" (+1d6)

**Heir**: "Uncle Mortimer loved demolition derbies..." (emotional connection)

**Skeptic**: "This is insane, but... at least no one gets permanently hurt."

*Roll 3d6+bonuses, narrate the ridiculous outcome together*

## Slide 10: Playtest Evolution Plan
### Playtest #1: Core Mechanics
- Do dice rules create engaging decisions?
- Are character roles distinct and useful?
- Does 30-minute timeframe work?

### Playtest #2: Balance & Flow  
- Adjust difficulty levels based on success rates
- Refine pacing and complication timing
- Test variety of spending scenarios

### Playtest #3: Polish & Refinement
- Eliminate unclear or unnecessary rules
- Ensure consistent collaborative storytelling
- Verify replayability and theme clarity

## Slide 11: Design Goals Achieved
‚úÖ **Collaborative Storytelling**: No individual winners, shared narrative creation

‚úÖ **Genre Simulation**: Captures absurd wealth comedy perfectly

‚úÖ **Quick Play**: 30 minutes allows rapid iteration

‚úÖ **Meaningful Choices**: Spending decisions have narrative weight

‚úÖ **Character Investment**: Roles create distinct perspectives and abilities

‚úÖ **Scalable Complexity**: Simple rules support complex emergent stories

## Slide 12: Why This Works
### Addresses Key Design Challenges:
- **No win condition for individuals** ‚Üí Shared success/failure
- **Cooperative storytelling** ‚Üí Collaboration mechanics reward teamwork  
- **30-minute play time** ‚Üí Focused three-act structure
- **Narrative focus** ‚Üí Rules serve story, not competition
- **Rapid iteration** ‚Üí Clear feedback mechanisms for improvement

### Creates Memorable Experiences:
- Players generate absurd, shareable stories
- Relationships develop through shared absurdity
- Each playthrough creates unique narrative outcomes

## Slide 13: Next Steps
### Immediate:
- Conduct first playtest with classmates
- Gather feedback on core mechanics
- Refine character balance and dice probabilities

### Iteration Plan:
- Focus each playtest on specific elements
- Document what works vs. what needs improvement
- Adapt rules based on actual play experience

### Final Goal:
Create a polished game that consistently delivers collaborative storytelling experiences about friendship, absurdity, and the ridiculousness of extreme wealth.
