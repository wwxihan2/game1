# "Spend It All" - Final Presentation Outline

## Slide 1: Title
**"Spend It All"**
*A Collaborative Narrative Microgame*

Inspired by "Hello Mr. Billionaire"

## Slide 2: Choosing a Specialized Genre/Trope
**"Inheritance Challenge" - A Narrow, Focused Trope**
- **Not a broad genre** like "comedy" or "drama"
- **Highly specific narrative pattern** found in multiple films:
  - Hello Mr. Billionaire (2018) - Chinese version
  - Brewster's Millions (1985) - American classic
  - Trading Places (1983) - Wealth and worth themes
- **Single movie structure generalized**: Takes Hello Mr. Billionaire's plot pattern and makes it replayable with different outcomes
- **Many possible stories**: Same structure, infinite creative spending scenarios

## Slide 3: Core Structure of "Inheritance Challenge" Stories
**Consistent 5-Act Pattern Across All Films:**
1. **Unexpected Windfall**: Character discovers potential inheritance
2. **Impossible Conditions**: Absurd restrictions revealed
3. **Creative Desperation**: Escalating attempts to meet conditions
4. **Everything Collapses**: Major setbacks threaten success
5. **Values Clarification**: Money becomes less important than relationships

**Key Structural Elements**:
- **Time pressure** creates urgency
- **Spending restrictions** force creativity
- **Escalating stakes** build tension
- **Relationship testing** reveals character

## Slide 4: Character Roles - Types of People in These Stories
**Five Essential Character Archetypes Found Across the Genre:**

üé≠ **The Heir** - Central figure, overwhelmed by responsibility
üíº **The Expert** - Professional who knows the system  
ü§ù **The Loyal Friend** - Emotional support, moral compass
üé≤ **The Wild Card** - Creative chaos agent, thinks outside the box
ü§î **The Voice of Reason** - Skeptical protector, points out dangers

*Each represents a different approach to the central challenge*

## Slide 5: Internal Conflicts - Emotional Needs
**Character-Specific Internal Struggles:**

- **üé≠ The Heir**: Worthiness vs. Guilt - "Do I deserve this wealth?"
- **üíº The Advisor**: Professional Ethics vs. Personal Loyalty - "Should I enable this madness?"  
- **ü§ù The Friend**: Support vs. Moral Concerns - "Am I helping or enabling waste?"
- **üé≤ The Wildcard**: Creativity vs. Recklessness - "Are my ideas brilliant or dangerous?"
- **ü§î The Skeptic**: Protection vs. Participation - "Should I stop this or help succeed?"

*These drive roleplay and character development throughout the game*

## Slide 6: External Conflicts - Obstacles & Goals
**Genre-Typical External Pressures:**

**Time Pressure**: 30-day countdown constantly looming
**Bureaucratic Obstacles**: Lawyers, accountants, officials monitoring spending
**Media Scrutiny**: Increasing attention as spending becomes visible
**Practical Limits**: Some things simply cannot be bought quickly
**Legal Restrictions**: Spending rules create creative constraints
**Social Pressure**: Family/friends questioning the protagonist's sanity

**Core Goal**: Spend exactly 10 billion dollars within restrictions

## Slide 7: Information Needs - What Players Must Discover
**Critical Knowledge Players Need to Uncover:**

- **Legal Loopholes**: How to spend within the inheritance rules
- **Vendor Networks**: Who can provide expensive temporary services
- **Bureaucratic Processes**: How to navigate complex purchases quickly
- **Market Limitations**: What's actually available at different price points
- **Risk Assessment**: Which approaches might backfire spectacularly

*Players discover these through gameplay rather than exposition*

## Slide 8: Plot Structure - Sequence of Scenes
**Three-Act Game Structure Mirrors Film Pattern:**

### Act 1: The Reading of the Will (5 minutes)
- Inheritance revelation and rule explanation
- Character relationship establishment
- Initial strategy discussion

### Act 2: The Spending Spree (20 minutes)
**Week 1**: Learning the ropes - small purchases, basic obstacles
**Week 2**: Rising stakes - medium purchases, complications emerge  
**Week 3**: Desperate measures - massive purchases, everything goes wrong

### Act 3: Final Judgment (5 minutes)
- Results calculation and inheritance outcome
- Character relationship resolution

## Slide 9: What the Rules Fix vs. What Players Improvise
### **Fixed by Game Rules** (Structure & Constraints):
- **Time pressure**: 30-minute real-time limit
- **Spending restrictions**: Clear prohibited categories
- **Character abilities**: Distinct mechanical roles
- **Difficulty scaling**: Spending tiers with set target numbers
- **Collaboration incentives**: Bonus dice for teamwork
- **Act structure**: Timing and escalation pattern

### **Player Improvisation** (Creative Content):
- **Specific spending ideas**: What to buy and how
- **Character relationships**: How they know each other
- **Problem-solving approaches**: Creative solutions to obstacles
- **Narrative details**: The story emerging from their choices
- **Complication responses**: How to handle setbacks

## Slide 10: How Rules Support Improvisation
**Structured Framework Enables Creative Freedom:**

**Character Roles** ‚Üí Players know their function but create personality
**Spending Tiers** ‚Üí Clear difficulty but infinite purchase possibilities  
**Collaboration Bonuses** ‚Üí Mechanical incentive but players choose how to combine ideas
**Complication Tables** ‚Üí Problems are generated but players decide solutions
**Success Conditions** ‚Üí Clear goals but multiple paths to achieve them

*"Rules as creative constraints rather than creative restrictions"*

## Slide 11: Sample Gameplay - Rules + Improvisation in Action
**Week 2 Scenario: Spending $800M**

**Rule-Fixed Elements**:
- Medium tier purchase (target 9+)
- Week 2 complication possible
- Character abilities available

**Player Improvisation**:
- **Wildcard**: "Let's buy 50 private jets and turn them into the world's most expensive food trucks!"
- **Advisor**: "I know aviation lawyers who could fast-track the permits" (uses reroll ability)
- **Friend**: "I'll coordinate with celebrity chefs!" (assists with +1d6)
- **Heir**: "Uncle Mortimer loved street food..." (emotional connection)

*Structure provides framework, creativity fills the details*

## Slide 12: Genre Authenticity Through Mechanical Design
**How Rules Recreate Film Experience:**

**Time Pressure Mechanics** = **Film Deadline Tension**
- 30-minute countdown mirrors 30-day story deadline
- Escalating complications mirror film's rising action

**Collaboration Requirements** = **Protagonist's Support Network**
- Bonus dice incentivize teamwork like films show friendship importance
- Character abilities represent different personality contributions

**Spending Restrictions** = **Creative Problem-Solving Pressure**
- Rules force same innovative thinking as film protagonists
- Prevents "easy" solutions that would bypass dramatic tension

## Slide 13: Replayability Through Improvisation
**Same Structure, Infinite Stories:**

**Fixed Framework Ensures**:
- Consistent dramatic arc
- Appropriate challenge level  
- Character role balance
- Genre authenticity

**Player Improvisation Creates**:
- Unique spending scenarios each game
- Different character relationship dynamics
- Varied approaches to same challenges
- Emergent comedy and drama

*"Every playthrough feels like a different movie in the same genre"*

## Slide 14: Design Success - Structure + Freedom
**Achieving the Assignment Goals:**

‚úÖ **Narrow Genre Focus**: "Inheritance challenge" not broad "comedy"
‚úÖ **Generalizable Structure**: Hello Mr. Billionaire's plot pattern works for many stories
‚úÖ **Character Archetypes**: Five roles cover essential personality types in genre
‚úÖ **Conflict Integration**: Internal/external conflicts built into character design
‚úÖ **Information Discovery**: Players uncover knowledge through gameplay
‚úÖ **Fixed Structure + Improvisation**: Rules provide framework, players create content

**Result**: Consistent genre experience with unlimited creative possibilities

## Slide 15: Questions & Discussion
