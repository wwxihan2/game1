## Character Development Tips

### For All Characters
- Start with clear personality traits, but let them evolve during play
- React to other characters' actions and decisions
- Build relationships through the shared experience
- Let failure and success change your character's perspective

### Creating Relationships
Before play begins, establish:
- How long you've known each other
- A shared memory or experience
- Why you're willing to help with this challenge
- What you hope to get out of this (besides money)

### Playing Your Internal Conflicts
- Express doubts and concerns out loud
- Let other characters influence your perspective
- Show how the experience is changing you
- Don't resolve conflicts too quickly - tension creates drama

### Working Together
- Build on other players' ideas even if they're different from yours
- Look for ways your character can help others shine
- Create moments of connection between characters
- Remember that group success is more important than individual spotlight

## Remember
These character sheets are starting points, not rigid rules. Let your character grow and change based on what happens in the story. The most important thing is to contribute to a fun, collaborative narrative about friendship, absurdity, and the ridiculous nature of extreme wealth.
