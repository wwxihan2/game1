# "Spend It All" - A Hello Mr. Billionaire Microgame

## Game Overview
**Genre/Trope**: Absurd wealth spending comedy - specifically the "inheritance challenge" trope where characters must prove themselves worthy through seemingly impossible tasks.

**Players**: 4-5 players + 1 Game Master (GM)
**Time**: 25-30 minutes
**Core Mechanic**: Collaborative dice rolling with escalating spending challenges

## Core Structure

### Character Roles
Each player takes on one of these character archetypes:

1. **The Heir** - The main inheritor, gets bonus dice for "personal" spending
2. **The Advisor** - Financial expert, can reroll failed investment dice
3. **The Friend** - Loyal companion, can assist others' spending attempts
4. **The Wildcard** - Unpredictable spender, can attempt the most absurd purchases
5. **The Skeptic** - Voice of reason, can prevent catastrophic failures

### The Challenge
The team has inherited 10 billion dollars but must spend it ALL within 30 days (game time) to prove they're worthy. However, they cannot:
- Simply give it away to charity
- Buy things of lasting value (real estate, art, etc.)
- Invest it traditionally
- Tell anyone about the inheritance

### Dice Mechanics
- **Standard Roll**: 2d6 for most spending attempts
- **Collaboration Bonus**: +1d6 when multiple players work together
- **Risk Factor**: Higher spending amounts require higher dice rolls
- **Consequence Rolls**: Failed attempts may result in complications

### Spending Tiers
- **Small ($1-100M)**: Roll 7+ to succeed
- **Medium ($100M-1B)**: Roll 9+ to succeed  
- **Large ($1B-3B)**: Roll 11+ to succeed
- **Massive ($3B+)**: Roll 13+ to succeed

## Plot Structure

### Act 1: The Reading of the Will (5 minutes)
- GM introduces the inheritance scenario
- Players establish their characters and relationships
- The spending rules are revealed
- Players plan their initial approach

### Act 2: The Spending Spree (15-20 minutes)
Divided into 3 rounds representing weeks:

**Week 1**: Learning the ropes (easier spending challenges)
**Week 2**: Escalating complexity (medium challenges, complications arise)
**Week 3**: Desperate measures (high-stakes spending, time pressure)

Each round:
1. Players propose spending ideas
2. GM sets difficulty and consequences
3. Dice are rolled collaboratively
4. Results are narrated dramatically
5. Complications are introduced

### Act 3: The Final Judgment (5 minutes)
- Calculate total spending
- Determine success/failure
- Collaborative storytelling of the outcome

## Internal Conflicts
- **The Heir**: Struggling with unworthiness vs. family legacy
- **The Advisor**: Professional responsibility vs. absurd situation
- **The Friend**: Loyalty vs. moral concerns about waste
- **The Wildcard**: Creativity vs. recklessness
- **The Skeptic**: Pragmatism vs. helping friends succeed

## External Conflicts
- **Time Pressure**: 30-day deadline constantly looming
- **Secrecy**: Cannot reveal the true reason for spending
- **Bureaucracy**: Lawyers, accountants, and officials monitoring
- **Media Attention**: Increasingly difficult to spend without notice
- **Practical Limits**: Some things simply cannot be bought quickly

## Information Needs
- Finding legal loopholes in spending restrictions
- Discovering expensive but temporary purchases
- Learning about ultra-luxury markets
- Understanding bureaucratic processes
- Identifying trustworthy vendors for absurd requests

## Failure Conditions
The game succeeds if players spend at least 8 billion (80% success rate). Partial success creates interesting narrative tension.

**Complete Success (9-10B spent)**: Full inheritance, happy ending
**Partial Success (7-8.9B spent)**: Conditional inheritance with ongoing challenges
**Near Miss (5-6.9B spent)**: One final chance with severe restrictions
**Failure (<5B spent)**: Lose inheritance but gain friendship/experience

## Sample Spending Ideas by Tier

### Small Tier ($1-100M)
- Rent every billboard in Times Square for a month
- Buy 1000 luxury cars and crash them artistically
- Hire celebrities for private performances
- Commission 100 custom suits made of rare materials

### Medium Tier ($100M-1B)
- Fund a completely useless scientific research project
- Buy a small island just to build sand castles on it
- Sponsor a sports team for one season with absurd conditions
- Create a temporary theme park in the desert

### Large Tier ($1B-3B)
- Launch promotional items into space
- Buy and immediately demolish expensive buildings
- Fund a movie with the most expensive cast possible
- Create a temporary artificial lake in a major city

### Massive Tier ($3B+)
- Attempt to buy and rename a small country for a day
- Commission a space mission for entertainment purposes
- Build the world's most expensive temporary structure
- Fund a global simultaneous celebration

## GM Guidelines

### Setting Difficulties
- Consider narrative impact over strict math
- Allow creative solutions to bypass normal restrictions
- Introduce complications that create story opportunities
- Balance success and failure for maximum drama

### Managing Complications
Each failed roll can introduce:
- **Bureaucratic Delays**: Paperwork slows down other purchases
- **Media Attention**: Harder to make secret purchases
- **Legal Issues**: Lawyers demand explanations
- **Personal Drama**: Relationships strained by the absurdity
- **Practical Problems**: Vendors refuse service, items break down

### Encouraging Collaboration
- Reward players who build on each other's ideas
- Allow combining different character strengths
- Create situations where multiple perspectives help
- Make solo attempts more risky than team efforts

## Victory Conditions
The game succeeds when players create a satisfying collaborative story about absurd wealth, friendship, and the ridiculousness of extreme spending. The inheritance outcome is secondary to the shared narrative experience.

## Design Philosophy
This game prioritizes:
- **Collaborative storytelling** over individual competition
- **Absurd humor** over realistic economics
- **Creative problem-solving** over optimal strategies
- **Shared success/failure** over individual winners
- **Narrative drama** over mechanical complexity
